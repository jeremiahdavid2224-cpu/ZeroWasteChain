# ♻️ ZeroWasteChain: Blockchain Incentives for Sustainable Manufacturing

Welcome to ZeroWasteChain, a revolutionary Web3 platform that tackles the real-world problem of manufacturing waste! In industries like textiles, electronics, and food production, excess scraps and byproducts contribute to environmental pollution and resource inefficiency. This project uses the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to incentivize manufacturers to achieve zero-waste goals by verifying reductions in production scraps and rewarding them with tokens. Verified data ensures transparency, while a token economy encourages participation and sustainability.

## ✨ Features

🔄 Track and verify reductions in production scraps using immutable blockchain records  
💰 Earn reward tokens for proven waste reductions, redeemable for benefits like carbon credits or partnerships  
📊 Real-time dashboards for manufacturers to submit and monitor waste data  
🤝 Community governance for updating reward thresholds and verification rules  
🔒 Secure oracle integration for third-party audits of waste metrics  
🏆 Tiered incentives: Higher rewards for consistent zero-waste achievements  
🚫 Penalize false claims with token burns or blacklisting  
🌍 Integrate with global sustainability standards (e.g., ISO 14001 compliance tracking)

## 🛠 How It Works

ZeroWasteChain leverages 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts to create a robust ecosystem. Manufacturers register, submit verifiable data on scrap reductions (e.g., via IoT sensors or audits), and get rewarded if verified. Validators (e.g., auditors or AI oracles) confirm data, and the community governs the system to prevent abuse.

**For Manufacturers**  
- Register your factory and baseline waste metrics using the RegistrationContract.  
- Submit periodic reports on scrap reductions (e.g., kg of waste avoided) via the ReportingContract.  
- Use the OracleContract to integrate external proofs (like certified audits).  
- Once verified by the VerificationContract, claim rewards from the RewardDistributionContract.  
- Stake tokens in the StakingContract for bonus multipliers on future rewards.  

Boom! Your sustainable practices are rewarded, and you can trade tokens on integrated DEXs for real-world value.

**For Validators/Auditors**  
- Stake tokens to become a validator via the GovernanceContract.  
- Review submitted data through the AuditContract and confirm or dispute reductions.  
- Earn fees from the TokenContract for accurate verifications.  

Instant, decentralized oversight keeps the system honest.

**For Community Members/Investors**  
- Hold and vote with governance tokens from the TokenContract.  
- Propose changes to reward formulas or thresholds via the GovernanceContract.  
- Monitor overall network impact through aggregated data in the ReportingContract.  

That's it! A transparent, incentive-driven path to zero-waste manufacturing.

## 📜 Smart Contracts Overview

All contracts are written in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain, ensuring security and Bitcoin-anchored finality. Here's the breakdown of the 8 smart contracts:

1. **TokenContract**: Manages the ERC-20-like incentive token (ZWC). Handles minting, burning, transfers, and balances. Rewards are minted here based on verified reductions.  
2. **RegistrationContract**: Allows manufacturers to onboard, storing factory details, baseline waste levels, and unique IDs. Prevents duplicates and enforces KYC-like checks.  
3. **ReportingContract**: Enables submission of waste reduction data (e.g., metrics, timestamps, hashes of proof documents). Stores reports immutably for auditing.  
4. **VerificationContract**: Logic for validating submitted reports. Integrates with oracles and validators to approve or reject claims based on thresholds (e.g., >20% reduction).  
5. **OracleContract**: Interfaces with external data sources (e.g., Chainlink-like oracles on Stacks) for real-world verification of waste metrics, ensuring off-chain data integrity.  
6. **RewardDistributionContract**: Calculates and distributes tokens based on verified reports. Includes tiered rewards (e.g., bonus for multi-period consistency) and handles claims.  
7. **StakingContract**: Allows users to stake ZWC tokens for enhanced rewards, validator roles, or governance power. Includes slashing for misconduct.  
8. **GovernanceContract**: DAO-style voting for protocol upgrades, like adjusting reward rates or adding new verification rules. Uses staked tokens for proposals and votes.  
9. **AuditContract**: Dedicated to dispute resolution and random audits. Validators use this to flag issues, triggering token penalties or rewards.  

These contracts interact seamlessly: e.g., a report from ReportingContract triggers VerificationContract, which calls RewardDistributionContract upon success. This modular design solves scalability issues in waste tracking while promoting eco-friendly manufacturing.
